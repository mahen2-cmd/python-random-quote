Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
My name is Muhammad Mahen Mughal
Learn whatever you want, however you want, in whichever way you want.
I would rather like to have questions that can't be answered rather than answers that can't be questioned
Another day another time
keep it going
Finale quote
Finish today
